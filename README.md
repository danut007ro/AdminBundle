# DG AdminBundle

This bundle can be used for generating admin interfaces and integration some javascript libraries like [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) and [Select2](https://select2.org/).

The implementation of the DataTables logic is decoupled from the source of data. This allows to implement custom adapter for data sources (like an external API). We provide adapter for [Doctrine ORM](https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineBundle). This concept was partly inspired from [omines/datatables-bundle](https://github.com/omines/datatables-bundle).
